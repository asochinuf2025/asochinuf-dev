# ASOCHINUF Landing Page - Design System Analysis

## Executive Summary
The ASOCHINUF landing page demonstrates **strong individual design creativity** across sections but suffers from **significant visual inconsistencies** that undermine a cohesive brand identity. While the purple color palette (#8c5cff) is consistently used, its application varies dramatically—from subtle accents to dominant elements. Spacing, typography, card styling, and animation patterns differ substantially between sections, creating a fragmented user experience.

## 1. VISUAL INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN SECTIONS

### 1.1 Hero Section
**Visual Characteristics:**
- Massive hero typography (text-8xl, font-weight 800)
- Heavy use of purple gradients in text (white → #8c5cff → white)
- Rotating text animation with spring physics
- Animated background blobs (scale/rotate with 20-25s cycles)
- Bold contrast with black background overlay
- Floating sparkle effects (5 on desktop, 2 on mobile)

**Issues:**
- Scale dominance: Hero text is 5-6x larger than section headings
- Animation style: Complex parallax (opacity, scale transforms) not repeated elsewhere
- Purple intensity: Gradient overlay on background is subtle (10% opacity)
